+ Project summary: In this project, we applied two algorithms: memory-based algorithm, including Similarity Weight (Spearman Correlation, Mean-square-difference and SimRank), Variance Weight (Used or not) and Selecting Neighbours (Best-n-estimator) and model-based algorithm, including Cluster Models to conduct Collaborative Filtering. And we used two datasets, Anonymous Microsoft Web Data (MS) and EachMovie Dataset (Movie) to evaluate and compare a pair of algorithms. For evaluation part, we compared the performance for these different algorithms by Ranked Scoring for MS dataset and MAE for Movie dataset.

The following charts give an exhaustive visual understanding of the performance of all the algorithms we used on different datasets.
