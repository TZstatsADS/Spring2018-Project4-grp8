# Project 4: Collaborative Filtering

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Data Set:
 
The first data set is Anonymous Microsoft Web Data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ Anonymous+Microsoft+Web+Data). It?s an example of implicit voting data, with each vroot characterized as being visited (vote of one) or not (no vote).

The second data set is EachMovie (http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~chuwei/data/EachMovie/ eachmovie.html). This is an explicit voting example using data, with votes ranging in value from 0 to 5.
